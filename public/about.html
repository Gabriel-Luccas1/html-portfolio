<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 26-year-old professional currently working as a civil engineer with a keen interest in 
  transitioning to a career in web development. I am actively engaged in continuous learning and 
  pursuing a postgraduate degree in full-stack development at PUC-Rio. In my free time, 
  I enjoy exploring new cafes and going to the cinema.</p>
